Hi there, and thanks for purchasing Soda!
=========================================

Soda is a package that is intended to change the basic way in which you develop with Unity.
Because of that, it is *highly* recommended that you read the `User Manual.pdf` before you get started.
The manual is a comprehensive document that is supposed to not only show you around Soda's features,
but also to tell you *how and when* to use it.

The demos included in this package are supposed to demonstrate the manual's contents.

Once you have a basic understanding, feel free to unpack the `API Documentation.unitypackage` for a regular class documentation.

If you have questions, issues or a feature proposal, please write an email to assetstore@13pixels.de.

Have a productive time!
